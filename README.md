# Ukiyo API

The Ukiyo API is an API developed in Go and the Gin framework to store and retrieve Ukiyo-e paintings. The database technology utilized is AWS DynamoDB. However, the architecture of the API is intentionally modular so that the underlying technologies can be swapped at any given point in time.

# Name

[Ukiyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo), or 浮世, literally means "Floating World" in the Japanese language and it is a Japanese term used to describe the urban lifestyle and culture, especially the pleasure-seeking aspects, of Edo period Japan (1600–1867). [Ukiyo-e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e), or 浮世絵, is a Japanese art genre that flourished during that same time period. One of the most notable Ukiyo-e artists is [Hokusai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai), with his rather famous painting called "[The Great Wave off Kanagawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa)".
